# TravelOfKnightExample
Example game for students. Mini-project that does not contain any other efforts than "design" and "development".

Design Points:
1. 64 chess tiles should be generated via script.
2. Knight initially is located in (0,0).
3. At any time, possible tiles to move appear blue(or other) color.
4. At any time, already taken tiles appear yellow(or other) color.
5. Score textbox(or button) shows the number of tiles taken.
6. If knight is stuck then score textbox prints "Fail"(or other appropriate words).
7. If knight's travel is finished then score textbox prints "Success"(or other appropriate words).
8. When restart button is pushed, game scene is re-loaded.
9. Other rules of knight's travel should be implemented appropriately.
